By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.\n\nSpike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.\n\nWhile developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2, 3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop__Tengoku_no_Tobira","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1439/93480l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"カウボーイビバップ 天国の扉"},{"type":"English","title":"Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"},{"type":"German","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Der Film"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Cowboy Bebop: La Película"},{"type":"French","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Le Film"}],"title":"Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira","title_english":"Cowboy Bebop: The Movie","title_japanese":"カウボーイビバップ 天国の扉","title_synonyms":["Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":2001},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 1, 2001"},"duration":"1 hr 55 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.38,"scored_by":219756,"rank":209,"popularity":631,"members":387131,"favorites":1634,"synopsis":"Another day, another bounty—such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop. However, this routine is interrupted when Faye, who is chasing a fairly worthless target on Mars, witnesses an oil tanker suddenly explode, causing mass hysteria. As casualties mount due to a strange disease spreading through the smoke from the blast, a whopping three hundred million woolong price is placed on the head of the supposed perpetrator.\n\nWith lives at stake and a solution to their money problems in sight, the Bebop crew springs into action. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Edward, followed closely by Ein, split up to pursue different leads across Alba City. Through their individual investigations, they discover a cover-up scheme involving a pharmaceutical company, revealing a plot that reaches much further than the ragtag team of bounty hunters could have realized.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Pictures Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/15/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":6,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1130/120002l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"bJVyIXeUznY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVyIXeUznY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJVyIXeUznY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/bJVyIXeUznY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Trigun"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"トライガン"},{"type":"English","title":"Trigun"}],"title":"Trigun","title_english":"Trigun","title_japanese":"トライガン","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1998-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1998-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":4,"year":1998},"to":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":1998}},"string":"Apr 1, 1998 to Sep 30, 1998"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.22,"scored_by":379994,"rank":361,"popularity":258,"members":780996,"favorites":16329,"synopsis":"Vash the Stampede is the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The reason: he's a merciless villain who lays waste to all those that oppose him and flattens entire cities for fun, garnering him the title \"The Humanoid Typhoon.\" He leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever he goes, and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact—or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs.\n\nWith his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash's agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The Japanese release by Victor Entertainment has different openings relating to the specific episode it's played on. The initial Geneon Entertainment USA (then known as Pioneer) releases on VHS and DVD (singles, Signature Series, and box set) used only the first opening on each episode. This was due to the Japanese licensor providing them clean materials for only the first opening to put the English credits on. Geneon later fixed this mistake on their Limited Edition tin releases in 2005/2006, as well as on the Remix singles. Following Geneon USA's demise in late 2007, the show went out of print. When FUNimation Entertainment picked up the show in 2010 and released it, they repeated Geneon's mistake of using only the first opening on every episode. This mistake was later fixed in 2013 on the Anime Classics re-release.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:15","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":7,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7/Witch_Hunter_Robin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19969l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"7UkaILjPk8M","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkaILjPk8M","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UkaILjPk8M?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7UkaILjPk8M/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7UkaILjPk8M/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7UkaILjPk8M/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7UkaILjPk8M/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7UkaILjPk8M/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Witch Hunter Robin"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"WHR"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Witch Hunter ROBIN (ウイッチハンターロビン)"},{"type":"English","title":"Witch Hunter Robin"}],"title":"Witch Hunter Robin","title_english":"Witch Hunter Robin","title_japanese":"Witch Hunter ROBIN (ウイッチハンターロビン)","title_synonyms":["WHR"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2002-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2002-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":7,"year":2002},"to":{"day":25,"month":12,"year":2002}},"string":"Jul 3, 2002 to Dec 25, 2002"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.24,"scored_by":44600,"rank":3099,"popularity":1908,"members":119597,"favorites":652,"synopsis":"Though hidden away from the general public, Witches—those with supernatural powers—have always existed in human societies. Neither numerous nor inherently evil, Witches are nonetheless capable of creating disorder by misusing their powers for criminal means. The task of solving supernatural crimes falls outside of the jurisdiction of normal authorities and is instead handled by the Solomon organization.\n\nHaving finished her training in Italy, Robin Sena transfers to Solomon's local Japanese branch, STNJ. Possessing powerful pyrokinetic abilities, she is herself a Witch, putting her at odds with STNJ's methods of dealing with rogue Witches. In particular, Robin opposes the use of an elixir called Orbo, which can weaken or even neutralize a Witch's powers. If Robin wants to find her place within the organization, she must find a way to navigate the internal politics of Solomon while also handling the threat of hostile Witches—but both seem to be dangerous for very different reasons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2002,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":8,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8/Bouken_Ou_Beet","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/21569.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/21569t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/21569l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/21569.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/21569t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/21569l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Bouken Ou Beet"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Adventure King Beet"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"冒険王ビィト"},{"type":"English","title":"Beet the Vandel Buster"}],"title":"Bouken Ou Beet","title_english":"Beet the Vandel Buster","title_japanese":"冒険王ビィト","title_synonyms":["Adventure King Beet"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":52,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2004-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":30,"month":9,"year":2004},"to":{"day":29,"month":9,"year":2005}},"string":"Sep 30, 2004 to Sep 29, 2005"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG - Children","score":6.93,"scored_by":6890,"rank":4586,"popularity":5485,"members":15997,"favorites":15,"synopsis":"It is the dark century and the people are suffering under the rule of the devil, Vandel, who is able to manipulate monsters.

As One Piece proved unsuitable for their target demographic, 4Kids Entertainment censored the show to meet their standards, and, in December 2006, they stopped its production. In April 2007, Funimation took over the series licensing, providing an uncut version that remained faithful to the original release. In Japan, the anime's first 574 episodes were released exclusively on DVD by Avex Pictures from February 21, 2001, to December 4, 2013. Blu-rays also became available with the DVDs starting on January 8, 2014. In North America, Viz Media released the anime on DVD between February 28, 2006, and June 26, 2007. Funimation has re-released and continued the series since May 27, 2008. From March 23, 2021, the DVDs were accompanied by Blu-rays as well.","season":"fall","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"09:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 09:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":416,"type":"anime","name":"TAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/416/TAP"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":252,"type":"anime","name":"4Kids Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/252/4Kids_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":22,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/22/Tennis_no_Oujisama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/21624.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/21624t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/21624l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/21624.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/21624t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/21624l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tennis no Oujisama"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"TeniPuri"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"PoT"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"テニスの王子様"},{"type":"English","title":"The Prince of Tennis"},{"type":"French","title":"The Prince of Tennis"}],"title":"Tennis no Oujisama","title_english":"The Prince of Tennis","title_japanese":"テニスの王子様","title_synonyms":["TeniPuri","PoT"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":178,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":10,"year":2001},"to":{"day":23,"month":3,"year":2005}},"string":"Oct 10, 2001 to Mar 23, 2005"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.85,"scored_by":85688,"rank":900,"popularity":1319,"members":188523,"favorites":3033,"synopsis":"At the request of his father, tennis prodigy Ryouma Echizen has returned from America and is ready to take the Japanese tennis scene by storm.

The continuous confrontations between the races have split the world into separate factions. The race of vampires, Methuselah, are affiliated with the New Human Empire; whereas the humans, deemed Terrans by the vampires, make up the Vatican Papal State. Furthermore, extremist groups like the Rosenkreuz Order strive to rekindle a war, despite the factions' attempts to avoid direct conflict.\n\nTo combat terrorist organizations, the Vatican has implemented the AX unit. Led by Cardinal Caterina Sforza, the AX agents investigate vampire-related disturbances with hopes that the Terrans and the Methuselah will one day achieve peaceful coexistence. Amongst the AX unit is priest Abel Nightroad—a seemingly disoriented but gentle-hearted fellow who is a fierce vampire slayer on the battlefield. Joining the unit as his partner is agent Sister Esther Blanchett, a brave and gentle young nun troubled with a tragic past. \n\nAs the two grow closer, they begin to uncover signs of malicious schemes and dark forces working in the shadows. But the path they walk is riddled with misfortune that might just force them to confront the memories that plague their hearts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Trinity Blood premiered in Japan on the satellite network WOWOW on April 28, 2005 and ran until October 6, 2005.

The artwork within the animated film was produced using an innovative mix of cel animation and digital effects.
